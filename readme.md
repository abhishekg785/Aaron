Aaron : A demo browser engine having the ability to render HTML and CSS.
========================================================================

A browser engine is the portion of a web browser that works “under the hood” to fetch a web page from the internet, and translate its contents into forms you can read, watch, hear, etc. Blink, Gecko, WebKit, and Trident are browser engines. 

The engines like Gecko, Webkit etc are a millions lines of code.

Well i have life :P , so mine is not millions lines of code , just a simple toy browser engine.
