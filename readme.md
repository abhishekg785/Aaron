Aaron : A small browser engine that renders HTML and CSS.
========================================================================

I had the compiler classes this semester all about complier design, parsing, parse trees and a lot of things i did not understand.
So i thought of giving a try to implement parsing :).

A browser engine is the portion of a web browser that works “under the hood” to fetch a web page from the internet, and translate its contents into forms you can read, watch, hear, etc. Blink, Gecko, WebKit, and Trident are browser engines. 

The engines like Gecko, Webkit etc are a millions lines of code.

Well i have life :P , so mine is not millions lines of code , just a simple toy browser engine.

'Aaron' is built using RUST programming language ( safe programming :P)
